\usage{
plot_peptide_data(
  dataset,
  select_all_proteins = FALSE,
  select_diffdetect_candidates = NA,
  select_dea_signif = FALSE,
  filter_protein_ids = NA,
  filter_genes = NA,
  output_dir,
  show_unused_datapoints = FALSE,
  norm_algorithm = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{your dataset}

\item{select_all_proteins}{plot all proteins. This will take a long time. Default: FALSE}

\item{select_diffdetect_candidates}{if "differential detection" was enabled (it is by default in \code{analysis_quickstart}), plot candidate proteins based on their zscores.
Valid parameters are positive numeric values that are to be used as absolute z-score cutoffs (5 or higher is typically reasonable; use \code{plot_differential_detect} to visualize the score distributions).
This selects all proteins that meet this criterium in any contrast, and plots these proteins in every contrast (include those where it is has a z-score below given threshold).
Alternative, set to TRUE to use an absolute z-score cutoff value of 4. Default: NA (disable)}

\item{select_dea_signif}{plot all significant proteins from DEA?
This effectively checks the "signif" column in the \code{dataset$de_proteins} data table (DEA results generated by MS-DAP), finds all proteins that are signif in any contrast, and plots these proteins in every contrast (include those where it is not signif).
Boolean parameter, default: FALSE}

\item{filter_protein_ids}{a vector of protein_id values that should be plotted. For example, you can find specific protein_id values in the differential expression result table and provide only these as a parameter
(in this case, set \code{select_dea_signif=FALSE} to ensure only your specific protein identifiers are plotted)}

\item{filter_genes}{a vector of gene symbols to plot (alternative for filter_protein_ids)}

\item{output_dir}{full path to the output directory}

\item{show_unused_datapoints}{should data points be shown for peptides that were not used in the differential expression analyses? i.e. peptides that did not pass the filtering prior to DEA (found in N samples in both experimental conditions). Boolean value, default: FALSE}

\item{norm_algorithm}{normalization algorithms. This should be exactly the same as the parameter your provided to \code{analysis_quickstart}}
}

\dontrun{
# example 1:
# <assuming you imported a dataset and applied analysis_quickstart()>
# plot all significant proteins found by DEA

  # should match analysis_quickstart() parameters !
  norm_algorithm = c("vwmb", "modebetween_protein"),

# example 2:
# filter the DEA results for some specific proteins, then plot these
pid = dataset$de_proteins \%>\%
  filter(dea_algorithm == "deqms" & qvalue < 10^-4) \%>\%
  pull(protein_id)

  dataset, filter_protein_ids = pid,
  # should match analysis_quickstart() parameters !
  norm_algorithm = c("vwmb", "modebetween_protein"),

# example 3:
# plot specific proteins by providing gene symbols (not case sensitive)

  dataset, filter_genes = c("shisa6", "gria2"),
  # should match analysis_quickstart() parameters !
