This vignette demonstrates a basic metric for “differential detection”
that is implemented in MS-DAP. Analogous to the [DEA
vignette](differential_expression_analysis.md), we will apply MS-DAP to
the LFQbench dataset but instead of testing the differences in
peptide/protein abundance values, we here compare the number of
observed/detected peptides between sample groups/conditions.

# Differential Detection

Some proteins may not have peptides with sufficient data points over
samples to be used for differential expression analysis (DEA), but do
show a strong difference in the number of detected peptides between
sample groups. In some proteomics experimental designs, for example a
wildtype-knockout study, those are interesting proteins. For this
purpose, a basic metric for differential testing based on observed
peptide counts is provided in MS-DAP as a situational tool. Importantly,
this approach is less robust than DEA and the criteria to find a
reliable set of differentially expressed proteins (by differential
testing) might differ between real-world datasets.

As general guidelines for differential detection, the recommended
default setting is to filter for proteins that were observed with at
least 2 peptides in at least 3 replicates (or 50% of replicates,
whichever number is greater). Use the plots of differential detection
z-score histograms to observe the overall distribution and start your
data exploration at proteins with the strongest z-scores to find desired
z-score cutoffs (typically an absolute z-score of 4~5, but this is not
set in stone for all datasets). This works best for DDA experiments, for
DIA only the most extreme values are informative in many cases
(e.g. proteins exclusively identified in condition A & found in nearly
all replicates of condition A).

## computing the z-scores

For each protein, in each sample group (/experimental condition), the
total number of observed peptides over all samples (/replicates) is
summed. So if e.g. some protein was observed with 2 peptides in all 3
replicates in the first sample group and only 1 peptide was detected in
1 replicate for sample group two, `nobs1=6` and `nobs2=1`. The weight of
each observed peptide per sample is adjusted to the total number of
detected peptides per sample (thus the “weight” of a peptide in one
samples might be 0.99 and 1.01 in another sample).

After applying user-provided filtering criteria, for instance to only
consider proteins for this analysis that were observed with at least 2
peptides in at least 3 samples in either sample group, a z-score is
computed. A protein log2fc score is computed for each protein as
`log2fc = log2(nobs2 + min2) - log2(nobs1 + min1)`. This score
distribution is standardized to z-scores by centering to the median
value and then scaling by a standard deviation obtained through a robust
fit (to reduce the impact of outliers on sd estimate).

For DDA datasets, two different types of scores are computed; 1) only
“confidencely detected peptides” are counted (i.e. MS/MS
identifications), and 2) all quantified peptides (including MBR hits)
are counted.

## load dataset

1.  load the Skyline output of the LFQbench study (<PMID:27701404> ~
    this file is bundled with the MS-DAP package, you don’t have to
    download anything).

2.  extract the respective group/condition of each sample by matching a
    regular expression against the filenames. This is just to
    demonstrate a more advanced utility function that may come in handy
    for bioinformatic analyses. In typical MS-DAP workflows, the sample
    metadata would be loaded from file (a csv or Excel table), as
    demonstrated in the [user guide](userguide.md).

3.  finally, we define the contrast: group A versus group B.

note; the sample-to-condition assignments were taken from
`process_hye_samples.R` @
<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD002952/files>

``` r
library(msdap)

f <- system.file("extdata", "Skyline_HYE124_TTOF5600_64var_it2.tsv.gz", package = "msdap")
dataset = import_dataset_skyline(f, confidence_threshold = 0.01, return_decoys = F, acquisition_mode = "dia")
#> info: reading Skyline report...
#> info: input file: C:/VU/code/R/msdap/inst/extdata/Skyline_HYE124_TTOF5600_64var_it2.tsv.gz

dataset = sample_metadata_custom(dataset, group_regex_array = c(A = "007|009|011", B = "008|010|012") )

dataset = setup_contrasts(dataset, contrast_list = list(c("A", "B")))
#> info: numeric variable: condition

print(dataset$samples %>% select(sample_id, group))

#> 6 lgillet_L150206_012 B
```

## classify yeast and human proteins

We here use a MS-DAP utility function to easily recognize the Human and
Yeast proteins, while ignoring E. Coli proteins and ambiguous
proteingroups (that match multiple of these classes). The
`regex_classification()` function applies the provided regular
expressions to the fasta headers of all proteins in each proteingroup to
determine classifications. If no fasta files were loaded prior to this,
as is the case in this example, the regular expressions are applied to
the protein identifiers instead.

``` r
dataset$proteins$classification = regex_classification(dataset$proteins$fasta_headers, regex=c(human="_HUMA", yeast="_YEAS", ecoli="_ECOL"))
print(table(dataset$proteins$classification))
#> 
#> ecoli human yeast 
#>  1312  3062  1786
```

## differential detection

We here run the differential detection function in MS-DAP that computes
a z-score for each protein based on the total number of detected
peptides per sample group. Further details for the computational
procedures are available at the *differential detection* section of the
[introduction vignette](intro.md).

``` r
# compute MS-DAP differential detect scores for all contrasts, only for proteins that were observed in at least 3 samples in either sample group/condition
dataset = differential_detect(dataset, min_peptides_observed = 1, min_samples_observed = 3, min_fraction_observed = 0.5, return_wide_format = FALSE)
#> info: differential detection analysis: min_samples_observed=3 min_fraction_observed=0.50

# add the yeast/human protein classifications to differential detect score tibble and filter to only keep human and yeast proteins
tib_plot = dataset$dd_proteins %>%
  filter(is.finite(zscore) & type == "detect") %>%
  left_join(dataset$proteins, by="protein_id") %>%
  filter(classification %in% c("human", "yeast"))

# histogram the scores, color-coded by classification
print( ggplot(tib_plot, aes(x=zscore, fill=classification)) + 
         geom_histogram(bins=25) )
```

## print true/false-positives for topN hits

To inspect the extreme values from differential detection analysis, we
here sort all proteins by absolute differential detection score, take
top 50 hits and count how many are yeast/human.

``` r
### top 50
print( tib_plot %>% 
         arrange(desc(abs(zscore))) %>% 
         head(50) %>% 
         count(classification) )
#> # A tibble: 2 × 2
#>   classification     n
#>   <chr>          <int>
#> 1 human              2
#> 2 yeast             48

### top 200
print( tib_plot %>% 
         arrange(desc(abs(zscore))) %>% 
         head(200) %>% 
         count(classification) )
#> # A tibble: 2 × 2
#>   classification     n
#>   <chr>          <int>
#> 1 human             22
#> 2 yeast            178
```

Taken together, the high true positive rates from this simplified
approach that is only based on detection counts suggests it could
complement the differential expression analyses (DEA) which is based on
peptide abundance values, particularly to rank those proteins that lack
data points in one experimental condition but not the other (eg;
proteins on which no DEA is possible). In our hands, this approach has
proven particularly useful in wildtype *vs* knockout APMS datasets
measured in Data Dependent Acquisition mode which yields many proteins
that have observed peptides in one condition but very few in the other
(thus cannot be used in DEA).

## ROC

Additionally, we can visualize the differential detection z-scores by
ROC to show these scores are much better than random (but ROC
performance is not as good as DEA based on peptide abundance values
obviously).

``` r
roc_obj = pROC::roc(tib_plot$classification, abs(tib_plot$zscore), levels=c("human", "yeast"), direction="<")
pROC::plot.roc(roc_obj)
```

## require at least N peptides

While we find that the differential detection metric works relatively
well for DDA datasets, we are aware that proteins that were observed
with only 1 peptide are less reliable. In the below example we’ll only
consider proteins with at least 2 peptides and then consider the
yeast/human classifications for the top200 proteins with the strongest
differential detection z-score. The false positive rate (human proteins
should not be differentially expressed in this dataset) is reduced when
compared to above results that used all proteins (i.e. including
1-peptide-proteins). In real-world datasets, we find that the reduction
in false positives due to the requirement of at least 2 peptides per
protein is much stronger than shown here on this (relatively easy)
benchmark dataset.

``` r
# set required number of peptides with parameter `min_peptides_observed`
dataset = differential_detect(dataset, min_peptides_observed = 2, min_samples_observed = 3, min_fraction_observed = 0.5, return_wide_format = FALSE)
#> info: differential detection analysis: min_samples_observed=3 min_fraction_observed=0.50

# analogous to above, obtain 'detect' based z-scores and add human/yeast classification
tib_plot = dataset$dd_proteins %>%
  filter(is.finite(zscore) & type == "detect") %>%
  left_join(dataset$proteins, by="protein_id") %>%
  filter(classification %in% c("human", "yeast"))

# now that we require at least 2 peptides-per-protein, print the classification for the top200 proteins
print( tib_plot %>% 
         arrange(desc(abs(zscore))) %>% 
         head(200) %>% 
         count(classification) )
#> # A tibble: 2 × 2
#>   classification     n
#>   <chr>          <int>
#> 1 human              8
#> 2 yeast            192
```
